Hi! My name is Veronika, I’m a student majoring in Software Engineering at the Western Ukrainian National University.

This repository contains my practical and laboratory works completed during the 3rd year of study.

Key project: TheMovieDB — the most comprehensive project of this course, a console application for working with a movie database.

The file “Team Project” contains a collaborative work — a website about food delivery developed together with my team.

And " Term_project" a data management module for the international passenger transportation registration system
